# Week-2 Assignment
#### Deadline : 29 Dec EOD
----------------
This week's assignment is long and  in total 3 parts. So, its recommended to start at the earliest. 

- The 1st part contains challenges on steganography and forensics on images, audios etc.

- The 2nd part is on Memory Forensics. This was not covered in class. So, you may need to look at [resources](resources.md) for this.

- The 3rd part is on OSINT.

Lot of these challenges are available online with their writeups posted too. Please don't search or look at them, until you have tried your best. If you are stuck anywhere, you can dm me for some hint/help. You don't have to submit everything; just try to do as much as you can.

### Part-2 : Memory Forensics

Solve the [Memlabs](https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs), from **Lab0 to Lab6**.

### Part-3 : OSINT

Solve exercises **001-010** from https://gralhix.com/list-of-osint-exercises/ [You should solve both the levels of each exercise.]

----------
### Submission Guidelines
- Make a folder with the naming convention same as earlier. In that folder, make 3 folders - `part1`, `part2`, `part3`. Then in each folder, make **seperate markdown file for each seperate challenge writeup**. For part3, include writeups to both levels of same exercise in the same file (Example: Writeups to both levels of `exercise001` should be present in `exercise001.md`).

    So, file structure should be like this: 
    ```
    └── aayush_anand-230025
        ├── part1
        │   ├── challenge1.md
        │   ├── challenge2.md
        │   ...
        │   └── challenge11.md
        ├── part2
        │   ├── lab0.md
        │   ├── lab1.md
        │   ...
        │   └── lab6.md
        └── part3
            ├── exercise001.md
            ├── exercise002.md
            ├── exercise003.md
            ...
            ├── exercise009.md
            └── exercise010.md
    ``` 
- File naming convention : `firstname_middlename_surname-rollnumber.md`
- Make a **pull request** with your folder with above format in [assignment-submissions](assignment-submissions/) folder.
- **Plagiarism is strictly prohibited and can lead to deratification**.
